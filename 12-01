semctl(descriptor got using semget, which semget in set(remember come in boxes pf >= 1), operation desired, data(union semun)

must have union semun {
  int val;                  //used for SETVAL
  struct semid_ds *buf;     //used for IPC_STAT and IPC_SET
  unsigned short  *array;   //used for SETALL
  struct seminfo  *__buf;
}; in main.c

union can hold largest possible piece of data it iwll eat, e.g. above can fit one of above, but not multiple
can do struct notation e.g. varaible.val = 


nowait, if blocking throw error dont wait
must chekc for errors 


semundo if you down resource and take it and crash, and you dont put it back noone can use it
this lets op system undo semop
